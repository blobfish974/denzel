## Launch the application

To launch the server and the api endpoints run 

```sh
❯ node app.js
```

Then, if you want to start the React App run:

```sh
❯ cd react-app
❯ npm start 
```



## Information on how i developped the app

At the beginning I had 2 collections (one for all movies and one for awesome ones) but one is enough!
I created a mongoDB atlas database which means you can have issue requesting the API (as mongoDB atlas only give access to specified IP adresses).


If you want commands to see some usefull commands and API queries used for developping see the commands.txt file.
